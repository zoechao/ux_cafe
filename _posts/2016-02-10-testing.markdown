An h1 header
============

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

There are ordered lists as well:

1. Foo Foo
2. Bar Bar
3. Foo Bar

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14").

Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.

Unicode is supported. â˜º


An h2 header
------------

Here's a code sample

{% highlight python %}
# Let me re-iterate ...
for x in xrange(10):
    print 'foo' + 'bar'
{% endhighlight %}

To know how to highlight code blocks, check out [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting)'s website.

{% highlight python %}
def foobar():
    print "Welcome to flavor country!"

{% endhighlight %}

### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot.

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

Tables can look like this:

size |  material    |  color
---- |  ------------|  ------------
9    | leather      | brown
10   | hemp canvas  | natural
11   | glass        | transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

A horizontal rule follows.

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.
oranges
  : Citrus!
tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Here's a "line block":

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

![example image](images/van-gogh.jpg)

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
