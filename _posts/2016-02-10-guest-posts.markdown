Chaplin has support for guest posts. That means that if you were to have another blogger write on your blog, just edit the `YAML` front matter like so:

{% highlight YAML %}
author: Guest Name
profile_picture: Source for the Picture
author_site: Author's Presence online
author_stub: Your Short Bio
{% endhighlight %}
